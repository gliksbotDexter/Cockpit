"""
Core utilities and bus implementations for Dexterâ€‘Gliksbot (stubbed).

This package contains minimal implementations of the TripleBus system
and policy overlay to allow the patched UI bridge to run without the
original upstream dependencies.  These classes implement enough of
the expected interface for the demo API, but they are not feature
complete.
